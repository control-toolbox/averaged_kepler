# Averaged Kepler problem

We may find here some resources about the averaged kepler problem with current. This problem is part of time minimal optimal control problems and more particularly, it may be seen as a Zermelo navigation problem.

Please visit the [online documentation](https://control-toolbox.github.io/averaged_kepler) to explore the optimal synthesis. All the codes to make the visualizations may be found [here](https://github.com/control-toolbox/Zermelo/tree/main/kepler). We refer to this [article](https://hal.science/hal-04433828)[^1] for more details about Zermelo navigation on the sphere with revolution metrics.
